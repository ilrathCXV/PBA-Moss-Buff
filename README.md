# Perk-Based Artefacts "Moss" Buff - Timer Extension, Cooked Mutant Food, Stronger Positive Effects
 This mod buffs the "Moss" benefits from the Perk-Based Artefacts mod. Note that this is meant for the non-2.1 version for the mod.

**Requirements for all users:**

Here is the main new elements for the description of the "Moss" perkifact:
- **Perk: CULINARY HYPERVERSITY**
  - Convert energy of raw mutant meat into special abilities
  - Lasts for 1 minute, but eating different mutant meat will override current effect and restart buff timer
  - Each additional "Moss" equipped will add 1 minute to the base timer (i.e. 2 "Moss" = 2 minutes)
  - Equipping 3 "Moss" allows Zone-produced and Stewed mutant food to grant their respective bonuses
  - Equipping 5 or more "Moss" removes any penalties from various mutant meat effects
  - Equipping 5 or more "Moss" strengthens all positive mutant meat effects by 50%
